# HT Learning Management System

Complete CMS/LMS built from scratch in PHP to replace existing CMS at Anglo-Chinese School(Independent). System uses a feed-based system to distribute messages and updates between teachers, administrative staff and students. The feeds are RSS compatible, removing the need for a separate app, and improving cross-platform compatibility.

Completed in 2009. No longer in use.
